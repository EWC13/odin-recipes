# odin-recipes
This is my odin-recipes repository, I first started by using my HTML skills, such as adding an image, adding a paragraph, using different header tags. 
I also added links through my webpage, these include relative and absolute links. I also used ordered and unordered lists within my webpage. 
I feel I have learned at least to the intermediate level of HTML.

I then proceeded to add CSS to my HTML website. I am very confident with my basic knowledge of CSS, I know how to add background colors, font colors, 
and change sizes to certain elements. I learned how to format the website, where to align text within the page.

Here is my [website](https://ewc13.github.io/odin-recipes/).
