        <ol>
            <li>Gather Ingredients</li>
            <li>In a 12-inch deep skillet, Dutch oven, or saut√© pan, combine spaghetti sauce and water, then stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. This should take about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add frozen meatballs and spaghetti and stir well, making sure spaghetti is completely covered by sauce. If necessary, you can add another 1/5 to 1/2 cup of water to make sure that all of the pasta is covered.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, cover skillet, and reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring frequently until meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165 F and spaghetti is tender. As the pasta cooks, you will need to stir more often to make sure that spaghetti doesn't stick together, and sauce doesn't burn. You may add more water or tomato sauce if mixture appears to be too dry.</li>
            <li>Top with both kinds of cheese and let sit for a minute or two to allow it to melt. If desired, top with shredded basil leaves. Serve immediately.</li>
