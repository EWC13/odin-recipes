        What better way to get that mardigras feeling then cooking your own fresh pot of jambalaya! 
        This dish is filled with all the ingredients from the bayou. Onions, bell peppers, celerey, crawfish, shrimp, sausage
        and much more make up this cajun delight. Not only does this dish taste fantastic, but it also looks great too.
